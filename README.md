## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop sophisticated algorithms to analyze sensor data, identify anomalies, and predict events. The system should offer actionable insights to optimize resource allocation and operational efficiency.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:
1. Area
2. Sensing Range
3. Transmission Range
4. Number of Sensor Nodes
5. Target Variable: Number of Barriers

The dataset consists of 182 rows.

## Feature Importance

We used the Gradient Boosting model to determine the importance of each feature. The key findings are:
- **Number of Sensor Nodes**: Most critical for detecting anomalies and predicting events.
- **Transmission Range**: Significantly impacts the prediction accuracy.
- **Area**: Important factor influencing the model's performance.
- **Sensing Range**: Contributes to the modelâ€™s predictions but is less important compared to other features.
